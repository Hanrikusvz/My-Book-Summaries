# My-Book-Summaries
I will be posting summaries of all books I read here. These books will range from self help books to business books that I have read.

I am from South Africa so most of my work especially spelling will not be correct has some of the books I have read is in american english and I learned english in the britain way.Some parts I have directly took from the book and placed into the summary, so spelling from different versions of english will be present in my summaries.

Please note that some ofmy summaries will not be understood if you have not yet read the book the summary is about.

I would also like to add that I know I am not the best summarizer of books out in the world but I hope that my posts will help where needed.

I would also like to give credit to all the authors who wrote the books I will and have read and posted summaries about.
